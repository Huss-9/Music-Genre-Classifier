## **Music Genre Classifier**

---

This project was done in collaboration with peers in the data mining subject.
The purpose of the project was to understand how different prediction models work. 
For this project we decided to use a music dataset containing plenty of features that were
obtained with the Spotify API. We found the dataset on Kaggle, the exact source can be
found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/vicsuperman/prediction-of-music-genre" target="_blank">here</a>. We decided to give this dataset a try because the music realm is very interesting to study with machine
learning, plus having all the interesting features included in the dataset. The following models were studied:

| Model      | Accuracy |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Categorical Naive Bayes + Gaussian Naive Bayes  | 83% |
| One Hot Encodig + Gaussian Naive Bayes | 78.6% |
| KNN  | 71.23% |
| Decision trees  | 87% |
| SVM lineal  | 87.92% |
| SVM BRF  | 88.62% |
| Ensembles Voting  | 80% |
| Ensembles Bagging | 89.9%  |
| Ensembles Random Forests  | 90.35% |
| Ensembles Boosting  | 90% |
